4. **Set Piece Situations** - Corners, free kicks, etc. show clear patterns

## Testing Workflow

1. **Find 2-3 different teams** - Get footage from different playing styles
2. **Extract DNA for each team** - See how different they are
3. **Generate counter-strategies** - Use Team A's DNA to counter Team B
4. **Compare results** - Validate that the analysis makes tactical sense
